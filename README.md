# Post-Newtonian results in the self-force regime

The results are typically given in a Mathematica notebooks and categorized by the spacetime (Schwarzschild/Kerr) or orbit type (e.g. circular, eccentric, etc). The results given the highest-order PN results known. Each subdirectory has a README that shows who has contributed to the growth of these PN series over the years.
