# PostNewtonianSelfForce

Copyright (c) 2018-20 Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit

The PostNewtonianSelfForce package provides a set of functions for working with
post-Newtonian expansions in the self-force regime. The results are categorized
by the spacetime (Schwarzschild/Kerr) or orbit type (e.g. circular, eccentric,
etc). The results give the highest-order PN results known. Each subdirectory has
a README.md file that shows who has contributed to the growth of these PN series
over the years.

Further details can be found on the [package homepage](https://bhptoolkit.org/PostNewtonianSelfForce).
