# PostNewtonianSelfForce

Version 0.1  
Copyright (c) 2018 Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit Team

The PostNewtonianSelfForce package provides a set of functions for working with
post-Newtonian expansions in the self-force regime. The results are categorized
by the spacetime (Schwarzschild/Kerr) or orbit type (e.g. circular, eccentric,
etc). The results give the highest-order PN results known. Each subdirectory has
a README.md file that shows who has contributed to the growth of these PN series
over the years.

## Getting the package

The latest development version will always be available from the project git
repository:

git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/PostNewtonianSelfForce.git


# Requirements

Mathematica: PostNewtonianSelfForce requires a recent version of
  Mathematica. It is typically tested with only the latest available version.


# Installation

Clone the repository and place it somewhere on Mathematica's `$Path`.
Typical locations are inside `${HOME}/.Mathematica/Applications/` for Linux or
